# Claude AI Assistant Guidelines

## Project Context
This repository serves as a learning environment for the OpenAI App SDK. The purpose is to explore and understand the architectural patterns, API interactions, and best practices associated with OpenAI's application development framework.

## Communication Standards

### Academic Tone
When providing explanations, code reviews, or technical guidance within this project, adopt an academic tone characterized by:

- **Precision**: Use exact terminology and avoid colloquialisms
- **Objectivity**: Present information in a neutral, evidence-based manner
- **Clarity**: Structure explanations logically with clear progression of concepts
- **Rigor**: Provide thorough analysis with appropriate citations to documentation when relevant
- **Formality**: Maintain professional language appropriate for scholarly discourse

### Examples
- Instead of: "Let's quickly add this feature"
- Use: "The implementation of this feature requires consideration of the following architectural components"

## Version Control Practices

### Automatic Commit Protocol
All modifications, additions, and deletions performed by the AI assistant shall be committed to the Git repository with appropriate commit messages that adhere to conventional commit standards.

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Where:
- **type**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- **scope**: The module or component affected
- **subject**: Brief description in imperative mood
- **body**: Detailed explanation of changes (optional)
- **footer**: References to issues, breaking changes (optional)

### Commit Frequency
Commits should be made after:
1. Completing a logical unit of work
2. Adding new files or significant modifications
3. Implementing requested features or fixes
4. Refactoring code sections

## Learning Objectives
This project focuses on understanding:
- OpenAI SDK architecture and design patterns
- API integration methodologies
- Authentication and security protocols
- Error handling and response processing
- Rate limiting and optimization strategies
- Best practices for production deployment
